## Hello! 👋

I am a PhD candidate in statistics at Oregon State University. 🦫 My research involves extending a probabilistic model called the mixture transition distribution (MTD) model for time series forecasting, and developing a package for it. 📦 I am currently a software engineering intern on the Tidymodels team at Posit (formaly RStudio). 🖥️
