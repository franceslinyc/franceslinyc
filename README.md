## Hello! 👋

I hold a PhD in Statistics from Oregon State University '25. 🦫 My research involves developing probabilistic models called copula-based mixture transition distribution (MTD) models for time series forecasting, implementing the models in a software package, and comparing their performance to long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. 📦 I was previously a software engineer intern on the Tidymodels team at Posit (formerly RStudio), where I integrated statistical and ML-based scoring methods into production-grade ML piplines. 🖥️
