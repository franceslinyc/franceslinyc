## Hello! 👋

- 🦫 I am a PhD candidate in statistics at Oregon State University, advised by Dr. Lisa Madsen & Dr. Charlotte Wickham. 
- 📦 My research involves extending a probabilistic model called the mixture transition distribution (MTD) model for time series, with application to energy forecasting, and developing a package for it. 
- 🌌 I am currently a software engineering intern on the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org) (open-source modeling + ML) team at [Posit](https://posit.co) (formaly RStudio).
- 🤖 My work focus on designing and developing the package [flitro](https://github.com/tidymodels/filtro), which implements filter-based supervised feature selection methods. 
- ⛷️ In my spare time, I enjoy skiing, hiking in the PNW, and watching thriller or dark comedy films and series on Netflix.
