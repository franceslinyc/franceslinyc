## Hello! 👋

I am a PhD candidate in statistics at Oregon State University. 🦫 My research involves extending probabilistic models called mixture transition distribution (MTD) models for time series forecasting, developing a package for them, and comparing them to deep learning LSTM networks. 📦 I was previously a software engineering intern on the Tidymodels team at Posit (formerly RStudio). 🖥️
