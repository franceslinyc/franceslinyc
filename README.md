## Hello! 👋

I hold a PhD in Statistics from Oregon State University. 🦫 My research involves developing probabilistic models called copula-based mixture transition distribution (MTD) models for time series forecasting, creating a software package for them, and comparing their performance to long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. 📦 I was previously a software engineering intern on the Tidymodels team at Posit (formerly RStudio). 🖥️
